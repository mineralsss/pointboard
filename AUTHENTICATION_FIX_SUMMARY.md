# Authentication Fix Summary

## ✅ Backend Issues Fixed

### 1. JWT Secret Mismatch
**Problem:** Different parts of the code were using `JWT_SECRET_KEY` vs `JWT_SECRET`
**Fix:** Standardized all code to use `JWT_SECRET`

### 2. Payload Structure Mismatch
**Problem:** Auth controller was generating tokens with `id` field, but middleware expected `sub` field
**Fix:** Tokens now include `sub` field that the middleware expects

### 3. Debug Endpoints Added
**New Endpoint:** `/api/test/auth` - For future troubleshooting and token validation

## ✅ Frontend Configuration Verified

### API Service Configuration ✅
```javascript
// src/services/api.js - Already correctly configured
this.axios.interceptors.request.use((config) => {
  const token = localStorage.getItem("token");
  if (token) {
    config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
  }
  return config;
});
```

### AuthContext Configuration ✅
```javascript
// src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx - Already correctly configured
const login = async (credentials) => {
  const response = await apiService.login(credentials);
  if (response.success) {
    const token = response.data?.accessToken; // ✅ Using accessToken
    const user = response.data?.userData;
    localStorage.setItem("token", token);
    localStorage.setItem("user", JSON.stringify(user));
    setUser(user);
  }
};
```

## 🧪 Testing Tools Added

### 1. Authentication Test (Guide.jsx)
Navigate to the Guide page and use the **"Run Authentication Test"** button to verify:

- ✅ **Local Storage Check:** Verifies token and user data are stored
- ✅ **Profile Test:** Tests `/users/me` endpoint (requires authentication)
- ✅ **Orders Test:** Tests `/orders` endpoint (requires authentication)
- ✅ **Real-time Results:** Shows success/failure for each test

### 2. Console Logging
Enhanced logging for debugging:
```
🔐 Starting authentication test...
📋 Local storage check: { hasToken: true, hasUser: true }
✅ User profile fetched successfully: {...}
✅ Orders fetched successfully: {...}
✅ Authentication test completed: {...}
```

## 🎯 Expected Results

### Successful Authentication
```
🔐 Authentication Test Results
Local Storage: ✅ Token found | ✅ User data found
Profile Test: ✅ Success
Orders Test: ✅ Success
🎉 Authentication is working perfectly! All tests passed.
```

### Failed Authentication
```
🔐 Authentication Test Results
Local Storage: ❌ No token | ❌ No user data
Profile Test: ❌ Failed (401)
Orders Test: ❌ Failed (401)
⚠️ Some authentication tests failed. Check console for details.
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### 1. Token Expiration
**Symptoms:** 401 errors after working initially
**Solution:** Tokens expire after 1 hour - user needs to re-login

#### 2. Invalid Token Format
**Symptoms:** 401 errors immediately after login
**Check:** Ensure backend is returning `accessToken` in login response
**Verify:** Token is being stored as `Bearer TOKEN` in Authorization header

#### 3. Cached Old Token
**Symptoms:** Authentication fails after backend changes
**Solution:** Clear browser localStorage and re-login
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('token');
localStorage.removeItem('user');
```

#### 4. Backend Not Running
**Symptoms:** Network errors or 500 status codes
**Check:** Ensure backend server is running and accessible

### Debug Steps

1. **Run Authentication Test** in Guide.jsx
2. **Check Browser Console** for detailed logs
3. **Verify Backend Logs** for any errors
4. **Test Token Manually** using `/api/test/auth` endpoint
5. **Clear Cache** if needed and re-login
